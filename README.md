IV Compatibility Line Minimization (Constraint Satisfaction Practice)
Overview

This project is a learning exercise exploring how to model IV compatibility as a constraint satisfaction in Python.

Given a list of medications and pairwise compatibility (compatible / incompatible), the script attempts to determine the minimum number of IV lines needed so that incompatible medications are never assigned to the same line.

This is conceptually similar to finding the minimum number of “buckets” needed under incompatibility constraints (i.e., minimum graph coloring), framed in a clinical workflow context.
